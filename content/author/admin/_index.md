Pleased to meet you! My name's Rowan; I'm a student and aspiring professional living in Vancouver, British Columbia. I was born in Canada, but spent a good portion of my life in the tech-driven bustle of silicon valley before returning to the Great White North to learn about the things I love and ski world-famous slopes. When I'm not studying or enjoying the outdoors, I like to build software that does cool things with data and cutting-edge mathematical science.
